    <p class="headline">Coronavirus Changes Work Environment</p>

    <p class="byline">By Char Freedberg</p>

  <p>Entertainment seems more crucial than before to keep people relatively sane during coronavirus since people cannot go to the movies or see live shows. Streaming services have helped people get the closest to live theater they could, especially with the release of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSCKfXpAGHc" target="_blank"> "Hamilton"</a> on Disney Plus.</p>

  <p>However, the actors and crew do not get paid for this experience. Instead, they are living off of minimum wage the Actor’s Equity Association gives them. </p>

  <p>Voice actors can still continue their work. They do have to update their home studios, but it is the only entertainment industry where actors are still getting paid for their efforts.</p>

<blockquote>"Not as many actors as you might think are able to do a studio recording from home."</blockquote>

  <p>Bob Bergen, the official voice of Porky Pig and several other Looney Tunes characters, has used his home studio to record for auditions before, but he never experienced voice acting studios recording and directing actors from home.</p>

  <p>“COVID has made [having a good quality home studio] a necessity,” he said.</p>

<!--Professional voice actors-->
<p class="chapter" id="Professional Voice Actors"><a href="#nav"><u>Professional Voice Actors</u></a></p>

  <p>Bergen is not the only voice actor who finds himself in a different situation, however. <a href="http://www.gregoryhouser.com/index2.html" target="_blank">Greg Houser</a>, a narration and commercial voice actor, is in the same boat as Bergen, but Houser finds himself to be more fortunate than most voice actors.</p>

  <p>“I’m getting about 20 - 25% more business as of late. Not as many actors as you might think are able to do a studio recording from home so several studios have been using me more than they might have normally. The current situation thanks to the pandemic has also given me an opportunity to reconnect with clients and studios I haven’t worked with in a while, which is part of that increase as well,” he said.</p>

  <p>There are some perks to Coronavirus cutting off contact between voice actors and their directors, though. “[Voice acting] is the only acting genre that kept on going with the quarantine.  Everyone had to upgrade, like I did.  But the only difference is we don’t have to drive in traffic between jobs,” Bergen says.</p>

  <p> </p>

  <p>Voice actors who dub their lines, like Kyle Hebert, have their own different challenges. When dubbing over certain lines, it is essential that the entire team works together to come up with accurate translations, that the voice actors understand the scene and that the dialogue matches the mouth movements the characters make.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/species-guide/orca-killer-whale/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw9IX4BRCcARIsAOD2OB1sCbsNd2Jlyynehzb5n73rkwDnTF20cuPVxsZYRv6ir-vIIcuIchUaAs-lEALw_wcB" target="_blank">second-most common death</a> among orcas is captivity, with the first being whaling. When brought into a human environment, these whales become different beings than in the wild, and many die before the average life expectancy is reached.</p>

  <p>On the flip side, killer whales are not dangerous in the wild, but since they have been held in captivity, four people have died at their hands. Three of these deaths were caused by one individual whale, Tilikum, who was the largest male in captivity until his death in 2017.</p>

  <p>"What we learn is that [orcas] are amazingly friendly and understanding and intuitively want to be your companion," Howard Garrett, an orca researcher, said in <i>Blackfish</i>. "And to this day there is no record of an orca doing any harm to any human in the wild."</p>

  <p>The most famous death caused by Tilikum came in 2010, when veteran trainer Dawn Brancheau was performing with the whale when <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/02/24/killer.whale.trainer.death/index.html" target="_blank">she was attacked</a> in front of a full crowd at SeaWorld Orlando. Reports soon after confirmed that she died from drowning and blunt force trauma from Tilikum. The incident sparked controversy with the parks as the safety of the staff was immediately in question. Studies have since shown that whales like Tilikum suffered from a psychosis after living in captivity for an extended period of time, causing violent episodes.</p>

  <p>Activists and animal rights personell have come full force at the captivity issue, especially regarding dolphins and orcas. <i>Blackfish,</i> the groundbreaking 2013 documentary, highlights all the trauma inflicted onto the animals and the deaths like Brancheau's that have been a result of long-term captivity. Since the documentary's release, SeaWorld has seen steady declines in attendance and fiscal earnings.</p>

<p class="chapter" id="outlook"><a href="#nav"><u>What Captivity Has Done to Parks and What Can Still Be Done</u></a></p>

  <p>After millions of people around the world watched the documentary, SeaWorld faced three of its hardest years in history. Visitor numbers fell off in the following years after changes failed to be made regarding animal captivity, until then-CEO Joel Manby annouced that SeaWorld would be <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2019/12/24/its-official-seaworld-orlando-to-debut-new-orca.html" target="_blank">ending orca breeding</a> and begin to phase out shows in the parks in 2016.</p>

  <p>The American parks showed an upswing in revenue at the end of 2018 and as last year's numbers begin to come in, it looks like SeaWorld is on the rise again. Orlando recently annouced a new killer-whale experience, where the trainers will focus on showing audiences the whales' "role in the ocean ecosystem, behaviors the animals exhibit in the wild, the importance of conservation to their habitat, and animal welfare practices at SeaWorld," Chris Dold, chief zoological officer at SeaWorld, said.</p>

  <p>It has not been confirmed yet if parks like SeaWorld will adopt Edge Innovation's "Flipper", but the award-winning prototype looks to be the first step in the new marine mammal entertainment industry. The brand new experience aims to keep SeaWorld afloat, while freeing dolphins and eventually other animals back to the wild.</p>

  <p>"These visionary designers have thrown a lifeline to sensitive dolphins who are exploited in 'swim with dolphins' encounters and archaic marine parks," PETA director of international programmes, Mimi Bekhechi, said.</p>
